# Logistic Regression from Scratch (Iris Dataset)

This project implements **Logistic Regression** from scratch (without using scikit-learn’s LogisticRegression), trains it on the **Iris dataset** (binary classification), and evaluates the model with metrics and visualizations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Implemented logistic regression with gradient descent.
- Binary classification problem: **Iris Versicolor vs. Others**.
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.
- Custom implementation supports:
  - Learning rate, epochs, early stopping.
  - Loss history tracking.
  - Probability-based predictions with cutoff threshold.
- Evaluation with **ROC-AUC score**.
- Rich visualization suite.
